A [[Solenoid]]. Inductors resist change in current. Inductors have a property called [[Inductance]].
A good analogy for an inductor is a flywheel, where angular inertia represents resistance to current change.

### [[Inductance]]
$$L = \frac{\Phi(i)}{i}$$
Inductance is constant so long as the given inductor's geometry doesn't change, as explained in [[Inductance]].
### Voltage
$$\Delta V_{L}=L \frac{di}{dt}$$
