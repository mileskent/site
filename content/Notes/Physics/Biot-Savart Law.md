A fundamental aspect of the concept of [[Electromagnetism]] is that a moving electric field creates a magnetic field. The direction of a field follows the right hand rule, with the velocity being the thumbs and the fingers being the magnetic field. $B \propto I$.
### Point Charge

In terms of a single moving charge, the magnetic field is as follows:
$$\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{q}{r^{2}} \vec{v} \times \hat{r}$$
### Live Wire

$$d\vec{B} = \frac{\mu_{0}}{4 \pi} \frac{I}{r^{2}} d\vec{l} \times \hat{r}$$
If the wire is infinitely long and straight
$$B = \frac{\mu_{0}I}{2 \pi r}$$
