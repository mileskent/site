The closed loop line integral of a magnetic field is proportional to the current the loop encloses. Right hand rule dictates the sign of the integral. Over a stationary path.

It is an incomplete model without [[Ampère's Law With Maxwell's Addition]] 
$$\oint \vec{B} \cdot d \vec{l} = \mu_{0}I_{enclosed}$$
There are a variety of [[Common Cases of Ampère's Law]].
